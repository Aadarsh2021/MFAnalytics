## 3. Market Stress & Downside Comparison (vs NIFTY 50)
| Regime Period | Avg Portfolio Downside | Avg NIFTY Downside | Protection Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **All Regimes (Max DD)** | 35.01% | 59.61% | +24.60% |
| **Regime D (Crisis)** | 0.00% | 0.00% | +0.00% |
| **Regime C (Dominance)** | 20.86% | 46.26% | +25.40% |

**Insight**: India's higher inflation volatility often triggers Regime C. The portfolio's Gold and Bond allocation significantly cushions the drawdown compared to pure NIFTY 50 exposure.
